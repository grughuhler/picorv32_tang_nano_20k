This directory contains a simple C program that runs on the
picorv32 core on the simple SoC.

The build environment is limited. Some things to know:

* BSS (data not explicitly initialized) is NOT set to zero.
* No standard library functions are available.
* It's possible I missed some section type in the linker
  command file.
* The SoC has limitted SRAM so program cannot be large.  See Makefile
  for setting the memory size.  The Tang Nano 20K supports 65536 bytes.
  The Tang Nano 9K supports only 32768.
* There is no provision for interrupt handlers.

You will need the gcc cross compiler for riscv.  On Ubuntu 22.04,

  sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf

Basically, edit main.c and "make".  This will create files in the
Verilog source directory (see conv_init.c)-- so you need to rebuild
and reload the FPGA bitfile.

Program conv_to_init inputs a binary version of the image and creates
memory initialization files (and some other files).

The system clock speed is set in the Makefile.

Hints:

  riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d prog.elf will disassemble the code.

  riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -x prog.elf shows sections and addresses.

  riscv64-unknown-elf-nm --numeric-sort shows symbols and addresses.
